This is a project done for the Functional Programming course at the University of Belgrade, School of Electrical engineering 2021.
It is meant to be used as a picture editing software tool with working GUI.
Written mainly in SCALA functional language, it is meant to follow the functional programming paradigm.

## GUI

The GUI part has been written with [ScalaFX](http://www.scalafx.org/) by also using [Gluon's Scene Builder](https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/) for easier FXML file manipulation.

Special thanks to the user Vigoo and other people who have worked on the [ScalaFXML library](https://github.com/vigoo/scalafxml)

## License
This project is not meant to be used professionally nor to be sold, but just for practicing FP and Scala. Please use official software such as:
[Adobe's Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html). Similarities were made as the programmer was accustomed to the tool and did not want to waste time re-inventing UI/UX.
