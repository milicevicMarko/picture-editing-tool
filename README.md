# Functional Programming course assignment

> Before you lose yourself in the code, take note that this is my first real 'functional' project written in Scala. There may be (most probably is or even the whole of it is) smelly code. I'm a beginner so don't be too harsh :)

This is a project done for the Functional Programming course at the University of Belgrade, School of Electrical engineering 2021.
It is meant to be used as a picture editing software tool with working GUI.
Written mainly in SCALA functional language, it is meant to follow the functional programming paradigm.

## GUI

The GUI part has been written with [ScalaFX](http://www.scalafx.org/) by also using [Gluon's Scene Builder](https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/) for easier FXML file manipulation.

Special thanks to the user Vigoo and other people who have worked on the [ScalaFXML library](https://github.com/vigoo/scalafxml)

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## License
This project is not meant to be used professionally nor to be sold, but just for practicing FP and Scala. Please use official software such as:
[Adobe's Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html). Similarities were made as the programmer was accustomed to the tool and did not want to waste time re-inventing UI/UX.
